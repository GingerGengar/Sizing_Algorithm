\section{Rationale}
\begin{comment}
\end{comment}
We need to determine $2$ very important things:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The thrust to weight ratio affects:
\begin{itemize}
\item acceleration:
\item climb rate:
\item maximum speed:
\item turn rate:
\item Aircraft Endurance:
\end{itemize}
\item The stall speed is directly determined by the wing loading and the maximum lift coefficient. Wing Loading will affect:
\begin{itemize}
\item stall speed
\item induced drag
\item take-off distance
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Sizing Methodology}
\begin{comment}
\end{comment}
\begin{enumerate}
\item First Method:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Firstly use the stall speed to determine wing loading
        Stall speed should be independent of engine size
    \item After figuring out wing loading, determine the thrust to weight ratio based on 
        takeoff distance
        Rate of climb
    \end{enumerate}
\item Second Alternative Method:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Determine the Thrust to Weight Ratio
    \item Determine the wing loading by direct computation 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Common Definitions}
\begin{comment}
\end{comment}
$q$ is the dynamic pressure of an aircraft flying. It is defined as
$$q = \frac{1}{2}\rho v^{2}$$
wherein $\rho$ represents the density of the air, $v$ represents the velocity the aircraft is flying at.
The \texttt{Matlab} script below defines the global variables that is needed for this entire simulation,
\lstinputlisting[language=Matlab]{../Global_Variables.m}
$$$$
The script below handles the global variable initializations,

\section{Stall Speed Constraint}
\begin{comment}
\end{comment}
Wing loading is basically the weight of the aircraft divided by the total wing area.
$$L_{wi} = \frac{W}{S} = \frac{1}{2}\rho v_{stall}^{2} c_{L,max}$$
%$$L_{wi} = \frac{1}/{2}*\rho*(v_{stall}^{2})* c_{Lmax}$$
%$$L_wi = 1/2*rho*(v_stall^2)*c_Lmax$$
Our typical would be around $c_{L,max} \approx 1.2 \to 1.5$, 
Sweep only reduces your maximum coefficient of lift. The \texttt{Matlab} implementation is shown below,

\section{Climb Rate Constraint}
\begin{comment}
\end{comment}
The cimb rate $G$ is defined as the ratio between vertical and horizontal distance travelled when the aircraft is climbing
$D$ is going to represent drag. 
\begin{equation}\frac{D}{W} = \frac{T}{W } - G \label{Kinematic Relation}\end{equation}
There is also another relation for drag to weight ratio,
\begin{equation}\frac{D}{W } = \frac{qc_{D,0}}{L_{wi}} + L_{wi}\frac{1}{q\pi A_{r}e} \label{Drag to Weight Ratio}\end{equation}
wherein $A_{r}$ is the aspect ratio of the wings, and $e$ represents the efficiency factor due to deviating from the elliptic lift distribution.
Substituting equation $\ref{Kinematic Relation}$ into equation $\ref{Drag to Weight Ratio}$ and solving for $\displaystyle\frac{T}{W }$,
$$\frac{D}{W } = \frac{T}{W } - G  = \frac{qc_{D,0}}{L_{wi}} + L_{wi}\frac{1}{q\pi A_{r}e} $$
$$\frac{T}{W }  = \frac{qc_{D,0}}{L_{wi}} + L_{wi}\frac{1}{q\pi A_{r}e} + G $$
wherein $c_{D,0}$ represents the zero-lift drag coefficient of an aircraft. For a clean propeller aircraft, $c_{D,0} = 0.02$. For a dirty propeller aircraft, then $c_{D,0} = 0.03$.
%$$\frac{T}{W }  = \frac{(q*c_{D,0})}/{(L_{wi})} + \frac{L_{wi}}/{(q*\pi*A_{r}*e)} + G$$
%$$T_W   = (q*c_D,0)/(L_wi) + L_wi/(q*pi*A_r*e) + G$$
The expression for thrust to weight ratio computations are implemented below,

\section{Estimation of Motor Power Rating}
\begin{comment}
\end{comment}
The equation below was found in page $118$,
$$\frac{T}{W} = \left(\frac{\eta_{p}}{V}\right)\left(\frac{P}{W}\right)$$
wherein $\eta_{p}$ represents the propeller efficiency, 
$P$ represents power of the engines, $W$ represents the weight of the aircraft,
$V$ represents the true air speed of the aircraft.

\begin{enumerate}
%This is derived from the RFP
\item From the RFP, compute $2$ of the most arguably important parameters: Wing Loading and Thrust to Weight Ratio
%This is for how much the powerplant system should weigh
\item Choose a motor-propeller combination that exists within the market, and figure out:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item The thrust that the setup can produce.
    \item The power that the motor will consume.
    \end{enumerate}
\item Based on the Thrust to Weight Ratio and the Thrust that the motor-propeller setup produces, figure out the loaded weight of the entire aircraft.
\item Based on the power consumption of the motor and the required endurance, as well as the specific energy of the batteries, determine the weight of the batteries.
%This is for an estimate for how much the wing should weigh
\item Based on the Wing Loading, and the loaded weight of the aircraft, figure out the weight of the wings.
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Based on the wing loading and weight of the loaded aircraft, figure out the area of the aircraft's main wings.
    \item Based on the area of the aircraft's main wings and the material of choice, estimate the weight of the wings.
    \end{enumerate}
\item We already know a few things: Weight of the propulsion system (batteries, motor, propeller), Weight of the Lift Devices (Weight of the Wing), Weight of the Payload, Weight of the Aircraft. Subtract the weight of all the known components from the total weight of the aircraft. This is essentially the weight for the fuselage and tail and excess margin mass. We seek to figure out a reasonable number for this fuselage weight.
\item If the fuselage and excess weight quota is too low, choose a propeller motor combination that gives a larger thrust. Re-iterate all the steps above using the \texttt{Matlab} script.

Take-off distance is shown in this equation for a propeller (Page $130$)
$$\frac{W}{S} = T_{op} \sigma c_{L,TO}(hp/W)$$
wherein $T_{op}$ represents
$\sigma$ represents the density ratio. This is basically just the air density $\rho$ at takeoff altitude divided by sea-level density
$c_{L,TO}$ represents the take-off lift coefficient. This is the maximum lift coefficient divided by $1.21 = 1.1^{2}$. This is because the aircraft takes off at around $1.1$ of its stall speed.
$hp$ represents 
$W$ represents take-off weight of the aircraft
