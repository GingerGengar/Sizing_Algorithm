%Based on Motor power draw, figure out total energy needed
% Batt_Energy = Motor_Power*endurance; %Batt_Energy must have units of J = J/s*s
% 
% %Based on how much energy the battery must contain and the specific energy of battery,
% Batt_Mass = Batt_Energy/Batt_Specific_Energy; %Units of kg = J/(J/kg)

batteryWeight = 0.58967; % kg
