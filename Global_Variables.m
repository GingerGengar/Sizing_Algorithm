%Global variable list
global L_wi; %This is a wing loading (N/m^2)
global T_W; %This is the thrust to weight ratio (dimensionless)
global rho; %This is the air density (kg/m^3)
global v_stall; %This is the stall speed of our aircraft (m/s)
global c_Lmax; %This is an estimation of how good is our biggest possible lift coefff
global q; %This is the dynamic pressure
global c_D0; %This is the drag coefficient near stall speed
global A_r; %Aspect ratio of the main wing
global e; %efficiency of the wing due to deviating from elliptic lift distribution
global G; %Gradient of ascent = rise of flight/run of flight
